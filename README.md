# Dota2 TI 12

Just for fun, looking at some data pertninent to The International 2023, aka, TI 12 that I was able to attend in person. So specifically, the matches between the top 8 remaining teams, competing for the Aegis on October 27-29 in the Climate Pledge Arena in Seattle.

It was a fantastic event culminating in the well deserved victory of Team Spirit. GG.

I wrote a [blog post](https://tomoumer.com/2023/11/15/was-the-international-12-worth-it/) detailing various parts of the process.
